# Question: URGENT PRODUCTION BUG: Our MEV bot successfully detects 8 swaps/min across multiple DEXs (Raydium CLMM, PumpSwap, Meteora, Orca) but ALL pool extractions are failing (0% execution rate). 

SYMPTOMS:
1. Raydium CLMM: Extracted pool address has 0 bytes (doesn't exist on-chain)
   - Example: Pool 'G1mBCfNt4eTd3VdrjYGiUANb3CTon45BFS7zRHA93xuf' -> Account size 0 bytes
   
2. PumpSwap DEX: Extracted address is owned by PumpSwap program (pAMMBay6oceH9fJKBRHGP5D4bD4sWpmSwMn52FMfXEA) but RPC says 'Unknown DEX program owner - likely a token account or wallet'
   - Example: Pool 'FPkkPoW1quwxon3EZKmkDqXfU1VQQ5QYJqz9MvmyLF5F' -> Not a valid pool

CURRENT EXTRACTION LOGIC (mev_sandwich_detector.rs):
- Raydium CLMM: Using accounts[0] (per your previous guidance)
- PumpSwap DEX: Using accounts[0] (you said index 0 like most AMMs)
- All parsers extract from instruction.accounts[X] in CompiledInstruction

QUESTION: Are we extracting the wrong addresses? Should we be:
1. Using DIFFERENT account indices than 0?
2. Deriving pool PDAs from instruction data/accounts instead of direct extraction?
3. Looking at INNER INSTRUCTIONS post-execution (we're using ShredStream PRE-execution)?
4. Parsing Jupiter V6 wrapper instructions differently (many swaps come through Jupiter)?

Please provide EXACT account indices or PDA derivation logic for:
- Raydium CLMM pool extraction
- PumpSwap DEX pool extraction
- How to handle Jupiter-wrapped swaps

We need to fix this urgently - bot is live but executing 0 trades.
